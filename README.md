# Iris Flower Classification using Streamlit

This Streamlit app uses the famous Iris dataset to classify iris flowers into three species based on their attributes: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. The app uses a Random Forest classifier trained on the dataset and allows users to input flower measurements via sliders to predict the species.

## Features:
- Input sepal and petal measurements using sliders.
- Predict the flower species using a trained Random Forest model.
- Displays an image of the predicted flower species.

## Installation

To run the app locally, you need to have Python installed. You can install the required dependencies by following these steps:

### Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-github-username>/iris-classification-streamlit.git
